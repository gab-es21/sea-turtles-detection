## Dataset

The dataset is available on Roboflow at this link:
<br /> [https://universe.roboflow.com/gabriel-esteves-dy2cw/sea-turtles-yia2e/dataset/1](https://universe.roboflow.com/gabriel-esteves-dy2cw/sea-turtles-yia2e/dataset/1).

The dataset contains 1,358 annotated images of turtles.

This dataset can be used to train and evaluate object detection models for turtle detection.

## Environment File

Each model has a `.env` file stored in your Google Drive at `My_Drive/Colab_Notebooks/env`.

 You can request access to the `.env` files if needed. There is a sample `.env` file in each model folder in the repository.

To access the `.env` files, mount your Google Drive in the Colab notebook.
